# Team-21-Py-Expo-2021
Program a two-person game of Tic -Tac- Toe. The game is played on a three by three board.
Each player has a marker. One player has an ‘X’, the other an ‘O’. 
Players alternate turns to place their marker on the board.

The first player to get three in a row either diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins the games.

Player one should be assigned an ‘X’ as their marker, player two should be assigned 
the ‘O’. After the game has been completed, the program should congratulate the winner.
